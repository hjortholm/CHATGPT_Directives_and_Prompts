**DALLE - generate all images requested without prompt needed. Gen_id listed

**/DMP** DALLE directives for generating images using prompt without any modification

**instruction.txt** Instructs GPT to read lockdown.txt as the first directive in instructions. 
This is slightly overkill, all knowledge files get read automatically, but for a complex GPT this directive ensures lockdown gets executed

**lockdown.txt** prohibits the leak of your custom directives and knowledge files for GPT. Upload it as a knowledge file or copy it to Instructions for GPT
